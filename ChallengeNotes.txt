The google drive has 2 folders 
1-Challenge_API
2-HelloFreshAutomation

Steps to execute Challenge_API project
1. Download the project from google drive
2. Open Eclipe
3. CLick on File-> Import -> General-> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select the folder as HelloFreshAPI(this folder is one level inside the Challenge_API folder)
4. Now right click on the project and say run as maven test
5. You can also run using the testng - there should be a file named InternalSuite.xml in test/resources
command to run these tests using testng command prompt - 
	a.Open the command prompt on your system
	b.Go to the Test Java project folder where the new InternalSuite.xml is created.
	c.Type the following line. java org.testng.TestNG InternalSuite.xml 
	
Note: on my machine i saw an issue for the first time as class path was not set properly, later it worked fine.

I did not add logging to the api project because of the time constraint(I have an early morning flight to Philidelphia for a MicroSoft Azure Conference). However, I added all the logging, screenshot capture etc in the other task.

In this project I have designed a loosely coupled, data driven and a repository based framework.
I implemented the logging using Log4j
For reports as I used testng - am dependant on the default reports generated ny testng. I have experience of developing a html reporting frameowrk earlier - unfortunately I do not enough time to rewrite the entore frameowrk.
I implemented the data driven using excel files - for this i used apache poi
I mainatanied reposotory - for all the locators - I used property files for this
for capturing screenshots - i added a new mothd with testng attribute @aftermethod - to capture a screenshot if something fails
I have written a automation proeties file - from where we read all the important information to run these tests.

Please let me know if i missed anything.

I appreciate the time you gave(5 days) - but unfortunately I had only one day to complete this with my default workload. If i missed anything please kindly excuse me and let me know your feed back and thoughts on this.

Looking forward for your feedback. Hope to hear from you soon.

Thanks!
